# numrep: Number representation and errors

This exercise will introduce several tools and concepts introduced in the reading.

* More examples of plotting in ROOT and gnuplot
* Signs of numerical inaccuracies in computer calculations
* Numerical representation in computers
* A first example of combining compiled C/C++ code with Python
* Ultimately, you will perform and exercise to do a precise numerical calculation while avoiding possible pitfalls of numerical representation

## Review of some plotting methods

The first part of the exercise is described in the Jupyter notebook: decay_and_bessel_plots.ipynb .  On Rivanna type 
> jupyter-lab decay_and_bessel_plots.ipynb 

and an interactive notebook will start in your web browser.  Follow the test in the notebook and complete the plot to show the difference between the up- and down-ward recursion relations for calculating the Bessel functions of order 0, 2, 5.

General comments about making good plots:

* Plots w/o axis labels or titles are never appropriate
* Use appropriate legend information to improve clarity
* Similarly color choices, x-y ranges of your canvas, and possibly offsets to your data distributions can be used to improve clarity
* Discuss with others what looks good / easy to interpret. This is part science, part art, but it is always important to present your work clearly if you want it to be taken seriously

**Update the notebook to show your plot and push this to your GitRepo.**
