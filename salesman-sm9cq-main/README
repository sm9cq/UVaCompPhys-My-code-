sales[23].plt : gnunplot scripts to plot the path on top of a map
             of North America produces sales_*.png


salesglobal.plt : Plot the path over the Mercator projection of the globe
	     ** Note: this will plot the solution with some errors, lines that
	     should wrap around the 'back' of the flattened globe will instead
	     be drawn across the plot.  Don't worry about this small.

sales*3d.plt : Optional 3D version of plot on surface of globe
               See the included comments about limitations affecting
	       the drawing with hidden surfaces.
	       Unfortunately, the 3d plot w/o hidden surface removal is
	       very busy and hard to read.  

world.dat : input data for gnuplot to draw world map
